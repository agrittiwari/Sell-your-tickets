                    Billie Eilish Pirate Baird O'Connell (/ˈaɪlɪʃ/ EYE-lish;[1] born December 18, 2001) is an American singer and songwriter. 
                    She first gained media attention in 2015 when she uploaded the song "Ocean Eyes" to SoundCloud, and 
                    it was subsequently released by Interscope Records subsidiary Darkroom. The song was written
                     and produced by her brother Finneas, with whom she collaborates on music and live shows. 
                     Her debut EP, Don't Smile at Me (2017), reached the top 15 in the US, UK, Canada, and Australia.

                    Eilish's debut studio album, When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? (2019), debuted atop the Billboard 200 
                    and became the best-performing album of 2019 in the US.[2] It also reached number one in the UK. The album contains 
                    six Billboard Hot 100 top 40 singles: "When the Party's Over", "Bury a Friend", "Wish You Were Gay", "Xanny", "Everything I Wanted",[a] 
                    and "Bad Guy", the last of which made her the first person born in the 21st century to achieve a number-one single in the US. 
                    In 2020, she released the latest James Bond theme song with "No Time to Die", which became her first number one in the UK

                <p>In October 2015, Eilish recorded the song "Ocean Eyes", written and produced by Finneas originally for his band, after her dance teacher 
                    asked them to record a song for a dance routine. They released the song on SoundCloud, as they had already done with a couple of songs they wrote.
                    The record and Eilish received praise and promotion from various media outlets and marketers, including radio stations and music supervisors 
                    such as Beats 1, KCRW, BBC One, Zane Lowe, Jason Kramer, Annie Mac, and Chris Douridas.[22] Finneas' manager had reached out to him after he made 
                    "Ocean Eyes" to discuss Eilish's potential. In a deal arranged by Finneas, Apple Music signed Eilish to A&R company Platoon, which helps 
                    package artists before they get a major label deal.[7][23] Eilish then got a publicist, who connected her to the fashion company Chanel, and
                     a stylist, both of whom helped shape her image.[7]

                    A music video for "Ocean Eyes" was released in March 2016.[7] By August 2016, Eilish had signed to the record label and artist management 
                    company The Darkroom, an imprint of Interscope Records.[7] Justin Lubliner, who signed Eilish to The Darkroom, developed her rollout as 
                    an artist, taking inspiration from the model of hip hop artists such as Travis Scott and Chance the Rapper, not relying on one big single
                     and focusing on creating a "persona and distinct aesthetic".[7][25] A video of Eilish performing a dance to "Ocean Eyes" was released in
                      November 2016, and the song was re-released worldwide through Darkroom and Interscope.[21][26] That year, Eilish also released the single 
                      "Six Feet Under", which premiered on Apple Music's Beats 1 radio show.[16][27] "Ocean Eyes" was certified platinum by the RIAA in September 
                      2018[28] and peaked at number 84 on the Billboard Hot 100 in May 2019.</p>
